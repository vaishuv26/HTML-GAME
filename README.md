# HTML-GAME

I successfully developed an engaging game utilizing the powerful combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:

1.User Input: Buttons or keyboard input lets the user choose a move.

2.Computer Logic: JavaScript randomly selects a move or uses logic to simulate a computer player.

3.Outcome Display: The game compares the user and computer moves, then displays who won.

4.Score Tracking: Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.

5.Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile.
